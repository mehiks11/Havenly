This project will involve helping with data report work at a local refugee-run restaurant. I will be looking through their sales data, promotion data (from several platforms, including social media, and food delivery apps) to discover general trends in promotions, including what types of promotions and timelines have worked best for them historically. 

A general problem the business has is that there is no determining when to run promotions beyond arbitrarily runing them. A solution path would include conducting an EDA on their sales and promotion data to discover emerging patterns in promotion efficacy, and also when running these promotions is most profitable. I believe the impact will be a clearer look at how well their promotions work, and also how these promotions actually impact sales. Measuring success in this project would include looking at how they use the findings of this report to run future promotions, and seeing if deliberate promotion placement leads to increases in sales. Some assumptions I am currently making are that there is a clear enough pattern to be found so far. They have been in operation for only a year now, so patterns might not emerge.
